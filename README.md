# PlayRight
PlayRight is a guitar tab app that allows users to create and share tabs of their own. It works with the music streaming services you love to display the tabs most relevant to you.

## Setup
* Assuming you have Node installed..`npm install -g expo-cli` to install Expo's CLI
* Clone this repo locally
* `cd 'PlayRight'`
* `expo start` or `npm start` to get things running
* It's helpful if you have the Expo app on your phone or you can choose to run it on an iOS/Android simulator - although you'll probably have to install Xcode/Android Studio
